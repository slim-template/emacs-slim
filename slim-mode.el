;; Version: 1.1
;; Keywords: markup, language

;;; Commentary:

;; Because Slim's indentation schema is similar
;; to that of YAML and Python, many indentation-related
;; functions are similar to those in yaml-mode and python-mode.

;; To install, save this on your load path and add the following to
;; your .emacs file:
