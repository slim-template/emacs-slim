# Synopsis

`slim-mode` provides Emacs support for editing
[Slim](http://slim-lang.com) templates. It's based on `haml-mode`.

# Installation

## Manual
Just drop `slim-mode.el` somewhere in your `load-path`. I favour the
folder `~/.emacs.d/vendor`:

```
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs.d/vendor")
```

You can enable `slim-mode` like this:

```
(require 'slim-mode)
```

## Marmalade

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of package.el
you can install `slim-mode` from the
[Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) repository.

## MELPA

If you're an Emacs 24 user or you have a recent version of package.el

## Emacs Prelude

`slim-mode` is part of the
[Emacs Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude). If you're a Prelude
user - `slim-mode` is already properly configured and ready for
action.
